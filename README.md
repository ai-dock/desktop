# Linux Desktop

Run a hardware accelerated KDE desktop in a container. This image is heavily influenced by [Selkies Project](https://github.com/selkies-project) to provide an accelerated desktop environment for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel machines.


## Documentation

All AI-Dock containers share a common base which is designed to make running on cloud services such as [vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/vast.ai) as straightforward and user friendly as possible.

Common features and options are documented in the [base wiki](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image/wiki) but any additional features unique to this image will be detailed below.
